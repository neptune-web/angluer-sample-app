# Introduction

A seed project for AngularJS 2 apps.

It is something similar to the AngularJS Quick Start but does the entire build with gulp.

# How to start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
npm install
npm install -g gulp
gulp build:lib
gulp serve
```

*Note: This repository exists mostly for bootstrapping my own experiments with AngularJS 2.*
